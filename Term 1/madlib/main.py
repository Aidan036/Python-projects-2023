Are you the (food)? No we are the hunters!

(Crimson) Bow and Arrow

Not knowing the name of the (trampled) flower
Birds that have fallen from the sky tower of waiting upon the wind
(Prayers) won't change anything
Only the (resolve) to fight can change the present

You pigs who sneer at our will to step over corpses and march onwards
Enjoy the peace of (livestock) false prosperity "freedom" of the dying wolves that hunger!

The (humiliation) of entrapment is our cue to counterattack
Beyond the castle walls lies a hunter killing his prey
With a surging killer impulse scorching his body, he pierces the dusk scarlet
With a crimson arrow

Drawing his bow, he takes after his target; he won't let it escape
Releasing his arrow, he closes upon it; he won't let it escape
He bends his bow to its limits, the string on the verge of snapping
He'll release it, time and time again, until his target draws its last breath

What truly kills a prey are not tools nor your skills at using it
But your own (sharp) killing intent

We are the hunter -> (passionate) as flames!
We are the hunter -> cold as ice!
We are the hunter -> pour your heart and soul into your arrow!
We are the hunter -> boldly go forth and pierce through everything!

Attack on the Titans.
The boy from back then will soon take up the sword.
Who only laments his powerlessness won't be able to change anything.
The boy from back then will soon take up the black sword.
Hate and rage are a double-edged blade.
Soon, one day, he will bare his (fangs) against fate.

Ones that could hope to change anything
Are ones who could bear to abandon anything
Without bearing any risk at all, how could you hope to attain anything?

Foolish assumptions they are but mere phantasms right now, we could do with even reckless courage
The advance guards of freedom betting on their offensive
Victory to the charging slaves!

All this absurdity forced upon us are our cue to attack
Deprived of his horizon, Eren yearns for freedom
With relentless killer impulse assailing his body, he carries violet to dusk-
With an arrow from Hades
